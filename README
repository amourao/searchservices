This is the image feature extraction component of the framework.

- classifiers
	Contains the classifiers used for tests and (possibly) as features
	At the moment, it contains kNN, SVM and SR (Sparse reconstruction and classsification by reconstruction error)

- extractors
	Contains the image feature extractors.
	Image features:
		Histogram
		Gabor
		SURF
		SIFT
	Face features:
		FaceDetection
		FaceRecognition
		FacialExpressionRecognition
	Image filters:
		Illumination correction
	
- sources
	Contains the image sources for the extractors and classifiers.
	Transforms an image path, directory, video or csv text file.

TrainTestFeaturesTools
	Useful to test and train the extractors and classifiers

TestFunctions.cpp
	Old main

Main.cpp
	Functions to test the system
